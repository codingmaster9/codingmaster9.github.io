            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a high school student in Washington-Liberty high school and I am taking IB HL I Computer Science.
                I have a strong interest in machine learning, and deep learning models.
                Throughout my studies, I have developed numerous projects, consistently applying and enhancing the skills Iâ€™ve gained.
                My hands-on experience in various programming languages and development environments has equipped me with a solid foundation to tackle real-world challenges in software development.
